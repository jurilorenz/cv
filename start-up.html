        <h3>Crafting Beauty, Nurturing Nature</h3>
        <p><br>
            🚀 As the CEO of "Online School ProFruket," I played a pivotal role in the successful growth and recognition
            of the start-up. Our focus was on teaching people how to create beautiful edible bouquets while being
            mindful of the environment.
            <br><br>
            👨‍💼 In my capacity as CEO, I led the strategic planning and execution of marketing campaigns, ensuring our
            unique offering reached a wider audience. We emphasized our commitment to sustainability and eco-friendly
            practices.

            <br><br>🌐 Taking charge of the website launch, I ensured a user-friendly and engaging online platform that
            highlighted our expertise and sustainable values.

            <br><br>🔎 To boost our online presence, I implemented effective SEO strategies, which led to our website
            ranking at the top of Google search results. This increased our visibility and organic traffic
            significantly, attracting more potential customers to our courses.

            <br><br>🤝 Additionally, I personally took charge of the CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system,
            focusing on building strong relationships with our audience.

            <br><br>🎉 Thanks to the collective efforts of the team, "Online School ProFruket" achieved remarkable
            success, selling over 1000 online courses and becoming a recognized authority in the field of edible
            bouquets with a strong commitment to environmental preservation.

            <br><br>🇩🇪 Unfortunately, in 2019, I had to step down from my role as CEO due to my relocation to Germany,
            but I am proud of the growth and achievements we accomplished during my tenure with the company.</p>
